            Pricezilla is one of UK’s biggest price and product comparison
            sites. We make it easy for consumers to find the right product, at
            the right price, and the right shop. We show prices from all online
            shops that we know of.

          <h2>Register your shop for free</h2>
          <p>
            You can register your shop. It’s free and it only takes a few
            minutes.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
          <h2>As a registered shop you can:</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Log in to your own shop’s site in our tool ’Pricezilla Analytics’
            </li>
            <li>Answer customer reviews</li>
            <li>Edit your shop info</li>
            <li>Name what methods of payment your shop is using</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Fill in our registration form to register your shop. There’s no
            start-up fee, and no on-going fee.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have registered your shop, we will review and approve it.
            Once done, we will send you a link that you use to sign in to
            Pricezilla Analytics. We will also start indexing your products and
            prices, if we do not have them already (we recommend that your shop
            has a price file, which you can read more about below).

          <h2>Faster updates – give us your price file</h2>

          <p>
            A price file helps to index the products and prices in your shop. It
            is placed on your servers and contains information about, for
            example, products, prices and stock status. We read the price file
            several times per day to keep the information on Pricezilla updated.
            If you use an e-commerce system, it’s very likely that it can create
            a price file automatically. <br />
            You register your price file while registering your shop. You can
            also register it afterwards by contacting our support. We only need
            the link to the file, not the entire file. If you rename the price
            file, move it to another location, or make other changes that may
            affect our reading, please email us again.
          </p>

        <section class="section">
          <h2>Price file requirements:</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The price file should have a static URL that doesn't change.
            </li>
            <li>
              The file does not have to be static, but can consist of a script
              that dynamically retrieves the information directly from the
              shop's database. If the file is static, make sure it’s updated
              frequently so that we always display the correct information on
              Pricezilla.
            </li>

              The file does not have to be static, but can consist of a script

              Pricezilla.
            </li>
            <li>
              The price file can be a regular text file. We prefer text files to
              complex XML standards, but we fully support Google Shopping’s XML
              file. However, we do not support Excel files (xlxs, xls) or the
              like.
            </li>
            <li>
              The fields in the price file should be separated by tabs,
              semicolons, or other appropriate characters not used in product
              names or other fields. Specify what each field contains in the
              first row of the file.
            </li>
            <li>
              Different versions of the product, such as sizes or colours,
              should be listed as a new product with a unique name and article
              number. We group them in our system if appropriate.
            </li>
            <li>The price file must contain your entire shop range.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
          <h2>These fields should be included in the price file</h2>
          <p>
            Product ID, or the shop’s article number (required): <br />
            Must be unique to each product. Never change, and never reuse for
            other products. Max 36 characters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Category (required):<br /> Must be the the full category, in tree
            structure, with as deep a category level as possible. The categories
            should be based on product type, and not brand, trademark or themes
            with mixed product content (eg, sales categories). Only one category
            can be specified per product. If the product is in several
            categories, the primary category should be specified.
          </p>
          <p>
            Brand / Manufacturer (required):<br /> The product's brand should, if
            possible, be available in a separate field. If this is not possible,
            it should be listed first in the product name field. Products that
            are missing a brand, or have an incorrectly defined brand are not
            indexed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Product name (required):<br /> The naming of the product, with model name
            and / or model number that makes it possible to identify the product
            is required. If a separate brand / manufacturer field is missing,
            the brand or manufacturer must be added first in the product name
            field (a separate brand / manufacturer field is ====strongly
            recommended). For products with different versions, the unique
            attributes of the current version should appear in the product name,
            such as colour, material, and model year. For products sold in
            different pack sizes (such as perfume, shampoo and food), the volume
            or weight should be stated in the product name. If it is a multiple
            pack, or bundle of multiple products, this should also be stated in
            the product name.
          </p>
          <p>
            URL (required):<br /> URL to the shop’s product page. If the product page
            doesn't contain its own URL, you can use the URL for the category
            page. If the shop uses UTM tracking, the tracking code should be
            added to a separate field in the price file. If the shop uses
            parameters in the URL to differentiate between product variants (eg.
            colour and size), the URL field in the price file should contain the
            whole URL, including the parameters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Price (required):<br /> Price of product, exclusive of shipping. Can be
            entered with or without VAT. If stated without VAT, it should be
            specified in the field’s header. The prices must be quoted in the
            official currency of the market where the shop will be listed. The
            price should be specified for the same sales unit as specified in
            the product name (for example, speakers sold in pairs must have
            price information per pair).
          </p>
          <p>
            Condition / Product Format (required):<br /> Specifies the condition in
            which the product is sold or in what format. If all products in the
            shop are sold in new condition, and are physical products, the field
            can be omitted completely.
            <pre> 
            "New" indicates that the product is sold in new order, in unbroken packaging.
            "Demo" indicates that the product has been used as a preview copy.
            "Used" indicates that the product is opened and used or restored (refurbished). 
            "Download" indicates that the product, such as a computer game, is delivered in digital format via download, 
          and not on physical medium.</pre>
          </p>
          <p>
            MPN / manufacturer SKU (strongly recommended): <br> Manufacturer's unique
            article number for the product., which allows us to index the shop's
            products much faster and more accurately.
          </p>
          <p>
            EAN-13 / GTIN-13 (strongly recommended): <br> The unique 13-digit barcode
            number for the product. Allows us to index the shop's products much
            faster and more accurately.
          </p>
          <p>
            Image links (strongly recommended): <br> One or more links to the product
            image. If there are multiple images, the link to the primary image
            is displayed first. The images should be without watermarks and
            other types of shop or manufacturer marks. The pictures should
            preferably be high resolution and have a white background. The
            images should correspond to the product variant, specified in the
            product name and in other fields, for example colour and packaging
            size.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shipping (strongly recommended): <br> Shipping price of the product. The
            total price of the product including shipping may also be stated.
            Specify in the field header if it's the shipping price or the total
            price, and if it's with or without VAT.
          </p>
          <p>
            Product description (recommended): <br> A more detailed description of
            the product than is included in the product name field.
          </p>
          <p>
            Multi-pack or bundle (recommended): <br> Specified if it is about the
            shop's own multi-pack or bundle, not if it is a multi-pack or
            bundle, that comes directly from the manufacturer. If there is no
            separate field for this, and the shop sells multi-packs or bundles,
            it should be clearly stated in the product name.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stock status (highly recommended): <br> Indicates the stock status of the
            product in the shop. Availability must be clearly stated so that we
            can also show it on PriceSpy. If the stock status is incorrectly
            stated, we reserve the right to hide the display of the shop’s
            inventory status.
            <pre> 
              "In stock" indicates that the product is delivered to the customer within six business days. 
              "Out of stock" indicates that the product is out of stock in the shop. 
              "Incoming [date]" indicates that the product is not in stock, but is expected to be in stock in the shop at a 
            known date. 
              "Pre-order [date]" indicates that the product has not yet been released, but has a known launch date. 
            </pre>
          </p>
          <p>
            Availability (required): <br> It is not mandatory to indicate stock
            status, but if the shop shows products that can’t be ordered at the
            moment, or can’t be sent to the customer, you must specify
            availability. "Can not be ordered" indicates that the product has a
            specified price in the shop, but it can’t be bought at the moment.
            "Pickup" indicates that the product is only available for physical
            collection, and can’t be ordered for home delivery.
          </p>
          <p>
            Colour or pattern (strongly recommended): <br> The colour or pattern of
            the product in question, if applicable to the product type. As far
            as possible, use the manufacturer's name (for example, "summit
            white" or "space gray").
          </p>
          <p>
            Gender and audience (recommended): <br> The gender or target group that
            the manufacturer considers fits the product if it is applicable to
            the product type. It may be, for example, womens, mens, unisex,
            girl, boy or child. If the shop does not have a separate field for
            this, and it is important for the product type, it should be clearly
            stated in the product name.
          </p>
          <p>
            Size (strongly recommended): <br> The size of the current product if
            applicable to the product type. Must be specified including size
            (for example, EU45 / US11 / UK12 for shoes), if there are several
            different size types.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
          <h2>Here’s how we index</h2>
          <p>
            We index all products that fit our active categories on PriceSpy. To
            index a product, we need to know the name of the manufacturer and
            the brand name. We usually do not index any "no name" products.
          </p>
          <p>
            We update PriceSpy several times a day to capture price adjustments
            and stock status at shops. When a shop adds new products in their
            assortment, which are not added to PriceSpy already, they must be
            indexed manually by us.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a shop makes many changes in a short period of time, it is
            possible to get ahead of the indexing queue to update the PriceSpy
            information faster. The shop can control this in our PriceSpy
            Analytics service.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a shop makes really big changes in the price file, the changes
            are placed in our quarantine for manual review. This reduces the
            risk of errors. If you know in advance that the price file will
            change significantly at some point, for example during a sales
            period, please email us to avoid the quarantine.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your products or prices are missing on PriceSpy, or if we display
            incorrect information, please notify us through our feedback
            feature. Feel free to go to the respective product or category page
            if it only concerns a few products or prices. If it concerns a
            larger amount of products or prices, please contact us via email.
