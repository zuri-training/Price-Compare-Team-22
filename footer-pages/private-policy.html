            <h2>Privacy policy</h2>
            <p>In the privacy settings, you can control the processing of personal data for various purposes, and also withdraw your consent.

            </p>

            <h2>Privacy policy</h2>
            <p>
                In order to give you the world’s best price and product comparison service, we need to process personal data. 
                In our privacy policy we explain what information we collect from our users, how we process it, and what we do to protect the integrity of our users.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="layout4">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This privacy policy applies to the processing of personal data that takes place within the framework of Pricezilla, that is, when you use the service Pricezilla at pricezilla.co.uk and in related digital applications ("the Services"). The service is provided by PriceSpy Ltd, with company number 08513484 ("Pricezilla", "we" or "us").
                Pricezilla is the controller of personal data as described in this policy, unless otherwise stated.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="layout5">
            <h2>Key concepts</h2>
            <p>
                Personal data means information which can directly or indirectly be linked to a living natural person. Examples of personal data include name, address, phone number, and email address. Under certain circumstances, information about IP addresses and your user behaviour when using the Services may also constitute personal data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Processing of personal data covers all use of personal data, such as collection, exchange and storage.
                Controller of personal data means the party which, alone or together with another party, decides on the purposes and means for the processing of the 
                personal data and who is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the processing takes place in accordance with applicable personal data legislation.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="layout6">
            <h2>Legal grounds for our processing of personal data</h2>
            <p>
                In order for our processing of personal data to be legal, we must have a legal ground. A legal ground in this case means that we must be able to present 
                a justification prescribed by law to why we process personal data for a particular purpose. Examples of legal grounds used by us are consent, legitimate interest, agreement, and legal obligation. 
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="layout7">
            <h2>Exchange of data</h2>
            <p>
                Your personal data will be disclosed to other companies insofar as it is relevant to achieving the purposes stated in this privacy policy. Such companies may also independently process your personal information in order to personalise and enhance your user experience and improve their products and services.
            </p>
            <p>
                In some cases we share personal data with our partners in order to let them personalise offerings and advertisements. We enter into agreements to ensure that our partners process personal 
                data in accordance with applicable privacy and data protection legislation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Personal data may be transferred to third parties in case the business or part of the business and personal data processed in connection with such portion are sold, moved or transferred. We may also disclose your information if we are required to do so as a result of legal obligation, court order, government regulation or if such disclosure is necessary to assist a criminal investigation or other legal investigation here or abroad. 
                If there is any suspicion that you have committed a crime in connection with the use of the Services, information may, upon request, be disclosed to the authorities.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will not share, sell, transfer or otherwise disclose personal data other than as set out in this privacy policy.
                International data transfers
            </p>
            <p>
                We may transfer your personal data to third countries. If we do transfer your data out of the UK, we take actions in accordance with applicable legal requirements to ensure sufficient protection for your personal data.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="layout8">
            <h2>Storage time for personal data</h2>
            <p>
                We only process personal data for a period of time necessary to fulfill the purposes set forth in this privacy policy. This means that our processing of personal data is limited to what is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which the personal data was collected. For example, we delete user accounts that have been inactive for 18 months.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which they were originally collected, we anonymise or delete them.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="layout">
            <h2>Your rights</h2>
            <p>
                As a user, you have a number of rights regarding our processing of your personal data. All rights are not absolute, but some of them may be limited. The rights you have regarding our processing of your personal data are the following:
            </p>
            <ol type="I">
                <li>Right to information</li>
                <li>Right to register extracts</li>
                <li>Right to correction</li>
                <li>Right to deletion of you personal data ("the right to be forgotten")</li>
                <li>Right to limitation of processing</li>
                <li>Right to data portability</li>
                <li>Right of objection to processing</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                You also have the right to lodge a complaint about us with the supervisory authority, the Information Commissioner's Office in the UK. For further information, please refer to the ICO website.
                Upon a request to have your personal data deleted from us, we will anonymise your posts, reviews, and your user account. This means that your reviews or posts published on the Services will remain if they don't contain personal data, though with an anonymous user ID as the sender. The 
                main reason why we don't delete reviews or posts is that these are an important part of Pricezilla. Without them, Pricezilla would lose an important part of its purpose. If you want to delete your reviews or posts in the Services, you have to do this before requesting a deletion of your personal data from us.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="layout">
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>
                We maintain routines and measures to ensure that no unauthorised persons gain access to your personal data and that all processing of personal data takes 
                place in accordance with applicable law. These measures include risk assessments, implementation of organisational and physical measures, as well as routines for handling of data and follow up requests regarding access to, rectification, block and deletion of personal data.

            <h2>Use of cookies and other technologies</h2>
            <p>
                We use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies to understand you as a user and to analyse data regarding users. 
                You can find more information about our use of these technologies in our cookie policy.

            <h2>Use of social plug-ins</h2>
            <p>
                When you use the Services, you may share information from the Services on social media, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter, through an implemented social plug-in (such as a 'like' button). If you choose to share information via a social plug-in, your browser will transfer the following data to the social medium:
            </p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>date and time of your visit;</li>
                <li>the internet address or URL for the address you are temporarily visiting;</li>
                <li>your IP address;</li>
                <li>the browser you are using;</li>
                <li>the operating system you are using;</li>
                <li>your username and password and, where applicable, whether you are a registered user of the social medium, your first name and surname; and</li>
                <li>the information for which you have used this specific plug-in</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                PriceSpy is not the personal data controller for the processing of personal data that happens after you share information via social plug-ins on the Services. The personal data responsibility lies with the social media that provide these plug-ins. For this reason, we refer to the respective social medium if you want to read more about the processing of personal data within the framework of the social plug-ins that we use. 
                Please note that you can block social plug-ins in your browser settings.
