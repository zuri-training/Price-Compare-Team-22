            <h2>Cookie policy</h2>
            <p>In order to give you the world’s best price and product comparison service, we need to store small amounts of data on your device. In our cookie policy, we explain which technologies we use, and what we use them for.

            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="layout2">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This cookie policy applies to the use of local storage of data and other similar technologies that take place within the framework of Pricezilla, that is, when you use the service Pricezilla at pricezilla.co.uk and in 
                related digital applications ("the Services"). The service is provided by Pricezilla Ltd, with company number 08513484 ("Pricezilla", "we" or "us"). </p>

            <h2>What is meant by local storage of data, cookies and similar technology?</h2>
            <p>
                Local storage of data means that data is stored locally on your device (for example on a computer, mobile phone or tablet) via your browser. Local storage of data may, for example, include your user settings, information on how you have used the Services, which browser you use, which advertisements have been shown to you, and how you have interacted on the web pages that we cooperate with.
            </p>
            <p>
                One type of local storage of data is cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your device and allows us to recognise your browser. Cookies do not contain any direct identifiers such as name, address, phone number, or social security number. Information stored in cookies needs to be combined with additional information for us to be able to identify users.
                We also use other similar technologies such as web beacons and pixel tags. These techniques can recognise cookies and identifiers so that third parties can place cookies on your device.
                In this document the term "local storage of data" is used as a collective term for cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, and other similar technology.

            <h2>Why do we use local storage of data on our websites?</h2>
            <p>
                We use local storage of data for the following purposes:
            </p>
            <ol type="I">
                <li>to provide the basic functions of the Services,</li>
                <li>to provide the basic functions of the Services,</li>
                <li>to personalise our Services, including advertising, and</li>
                <li>to target ads and to create target groups for marketing purposes.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>A more detailed explanation of the purposes follows below:</p>
            <ol type="I">
                <li>To provide the basic functions of the Services
                    In order for us to be able to offer the basic functions of the Services, we need to use local storage of data. Such functions include, among other things, saving of what choices our users have made, adapting the Services according to the user's technical conditions, and storing which searches a user previously has made.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To analyse and improve the Services
                    We collect information about the traffic to and on the Services by using local storage of data. In this way, we can recognise browsers, collect statistics on the use of the Services, and understand which parts of the Services are most interesting for our users. We transform this information into statistics in order to analyse them with the aim of improving PriceSpy, but also other services provided by our partners.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To personalise our Services, including advertising
                        In order to adapt the content of the Services according to what our users are interested in, we use local storage of data. In this way, we can remember which products you have looked at and make qualified assessments of what you might be interested in.
                   This purpose also includes our and our partners’ use of local storage of data on the Services, in order to personalise ads. Through this use of local storage of data, we can get information about how often you have seen an ad, how much time that has passed since you saw the ad, and how you acted after you saw it. The locally stored data helps us build segments and target groups in order for us to target our and our partners’ advertising in an optimal way.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To target ads and to create target groups for marketing purposes
                    We allow carefully selected third parties to use local storage of data on our users' devices for the purpose of targeting ads and creating target groups so that we and our partners can target ads and marketing to our users. The use of local storage of data for this purpose increases the possibility for you to get relevant marketing online. It happens that the third parties who place cookies on our users' devices are also able to gather personal data. You can read more about this in our privacy policy.

            <h2>Who else uses local storage of data on our websites?</h2>
            <p>
                We allow carefully selected partners to use local storage of data on the Services. In cases where third parties also take part of personal data for which we are personal data controllers, we enter into special agreements with them so 
                that this takes place in accordance with applicable legislation. You can read more about our and our partners' processing of personal data in our privacy policy.

        <section class="layout">
            <h2>How can I control what information is sent to advertisers?</h2>
            <p>If you want to control what information is sent to advertisers, you can download an opt-out cookie from different advertisers or use alternative solutions, such as youronlinechoices.com. Note that you must follow the same process for each device you use, and for each web browser on your devices.

            </p>
            <p>
                You can also control our and our partners' processing of personal data in our privacy settings.
